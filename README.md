# Simple Ordered Set

Minimal drop-in replacements for Python `set` and `frozenset` with
deterministic iteration order, determined by order of first insertion.

# TODO

* Add type annotations.
* Add unit tests.
* Check with mypy.
* Fill in missing methods such as `__eq__` for `OrderedSet`.
* Publish PyPI package.
